# AVERA-MAX LIVE CODING SESSION

Welcome, This is a live coding session aimed to access you.

You have `45 minutes` to attempt `3 challenges`.

In the `lib` folder, there are 4 folders, `q1`, `q2`, `q3` and `test` folder. The `q` folders contain the
challenges while the `test` folder contains the Dart Test Suites that would check your code.

In each `q` folder, there are 2 files: a `README.md` file and an `index.dart` file. The `README.md` file contains the
instructions for the challenge and the `index.dart` file is where you would write your code.

For each challenge, there is an accompanying `Dart Test Suite` to help test the correctness of your solutions.

At any point, you can run the `test suite` for any challenge you are working on by running `dart test test/{name_of_challenge}.dart` in
your terminal. For example; say you are working on the challenge in the `q1 folder`, you can at anytime, run the test
suite for `q1` by running:

```bash
dart test test/q1.dart
```

#### NOTES

* Try to answer as many questions as you can.
* Take your time to carefully read the instructions for each challenge.

#### SUBMISSION

When you are done or the timer runs out, You are required to:

1. Open your terminal and run `dart test` to test all the challenges.
2. take a screenshot of the output and send using the `Zoom in-call chat` feature.

Ensure the last portion of the output (where the total result is shown) is visible in the screenshot.

#### READY?

Ready to begin? Open any `Clock App` on your PC or Mac and set a timer for `45 Minutes`.

You can also use [This Google Link](https://www.google.com/search?q=timer+45+minutes&oq=timer#cobssid=s) to set a 45
minutes
timer.

### Good luck ðŸ¥³.
